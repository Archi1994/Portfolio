### Fraud Detection

Fraud detection is a set of activities undertaken to prevent money or property from being obtained through false pretenses.

Fraud detection is applied to many industries such as banking or insurance. In banking, fraud may include forging checks or using stolen credit cards. Other forms of fraud may involve exaggerating losses or causing an accident with the sole intent for the payout.
